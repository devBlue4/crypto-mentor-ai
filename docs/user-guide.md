- Where to use it: **AI Chat** or **Strategies** tab
- Suggested prompt:
  ```text
  Analyze address 0x1C680f16b2270e324D5778305C9EC96784c832ab and give app recommendations and strategies in natural language form, with a description of what each one does.
  ```
- Tip: on screen you'll see the address in short format (0x1C680f‚Ä¶32ab) for better readability, but it's sent complete to the API.
